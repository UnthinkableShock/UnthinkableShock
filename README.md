- 👋 Hi, I’m @UnthinkableShock
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my knowledge 
Of the coding languages I know, and I'm open
To learning new coding languages.
- Languages I have moderate experience
With: Python, C, C#, C++, and Javascript, Java,
- Languages I have less experience with,
But have used before:
Html and CSS
